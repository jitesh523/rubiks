## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Webcam/camera
- Good lighting conditions
- A scrambled Rubik's cube

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jitesh523/rubiks.git
   cd rubiks
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
   # or
   venv\\Scripts\\activate     # On Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 🎮 How to Use

### Option 1: Full Camera Experience (Recommended)

1. **Select option 1** from the main menu
2. **Scan all 6 faces** in this order:
   - U (Up/White) - Top face
   - R (Right/Red) - Right face  
   - F (Front/Green) - Front face
   - D (Down/Yellow) - Bottom face
   - L (Left/Orange) - Left face
   - B (Back/Blue) - Back face

3. **For each face:**
   - Hold cube steady with the face centered in view
   - Align with the green grid overlay
   - Press **SPACE** when colors are clear
   - Press **Enter** to continue to next face

4. **Choose guidance method:**
   - Visual + Audio (recommended)
   - Text-only
   - Show solution only

5. **Follow the moves:**
   - Watch on-screen instructions
   - Listen to spoken directions
   - Press **SPACE** after completing each move
   - Press **R** to repeat current instruction

### Option 2: Manual Entry

If camera scanning doesn't work well, you can manually enter the cube state as a 54-character string using face notation (URFDLB).

### Option 3: Test Mode

Test the solver with a solved cube to verify everything works correctly.

## 🎨 Cube Color Mapping

Standard Rubik's cube colors:
- **U (Up)**: White ⚪
- **R (Right)**: Red 🔴
- **F (Front)**: Green 🟢
- **D (Down)**: Yellow 🟡
- **L (Left)**: Orange 🟠
- **B (Back)**: Blue 🔵

## 🔄 Move Notation

The solver uses standard Rubik's cube notation:
- **R** = Right face clockwise
- **R'** = Right face counter-clockwise  
- **R2** = Right face 180 degrees
- Same pattern for L, U, D, F, B faces

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

### Camera Scanning:
- **Good lighting** - Avoid shadows and harsh lights
- **Clean cube** - Wipe faces for better color detection
- **Steady hands** - Keep cube still during capture
- **Proper distance** - Fill the grid but don't overfill
- **Correct orientation** - Follow the face order exactly

### Solving:
- **Take your time** - No need to rush through moves
- **Double-check** - Verify each move before pressing SPACE
- **Ask for repeats** - Press R if you missed an instruction
- **Stay organized** - Keep track of which face is which

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system consists of 4 main modules:

### 1. `cube_scanner.py` - Computer Vision
- Camera interface and video capture
- Color detection using HSV color space
- 3x3 grid overlay and guidance
- Color-to-notation conversion
- Cube state validation

### 2. `cube_solver.py` - Algorithm Engine  
- Kociemba algorithm integration
- Solution optimization
- Move parsing and explanation
- Progress tracking

### 3. `move_tracker.py` - User Guidance
- Visual instruction display
- Text-to-speech integration
- Progress visualization
- Move-by-move guidance
- Completion celebration

### 4. `main.py` - Application Controller
- Menu system and user interface
- Component orchestration  
- Error handling
- Multiple input methods

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Camera Issues:
- **No camera detected**: Check camera permissions and connections
- **Poor color detection**: Improve lighting, clean cube faces
- **Colors wrong**: Try different lighting or manual color correction

### Solving Issues:
- **Invalid cube state**: Re-scan more carefully or check for stickers
- **Solution not working**: Verify you're following moves correctly
- **Audio not working**: Check system volume and TTS installation

### Performance:
- **Slow scanning**: Close other camera applications
- **Lag during guidance**: Reduce other running applications

### Color Detection:
Uses HSV color space for robust color recognition under varying lighting conditions. Each color has calibrated hue, saturation, and value ranges.

### Solving Algorithm:
Implements Herbert Kociemba's two-phase algorithm:
- **Phase 1**: Get to a state solvable using only R, L, F2, B2, U, D
- **Phase 2**: Solve using only those moves
- Guarantees solution in ≤20 moves

## 🎯 Future Enhancements
